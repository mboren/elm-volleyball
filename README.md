# Exploding volleyball

This is a simple 2D game that I'm writing to play with Elm.

## Gameplay
 - two players bounce a bomb back and forth over a net in the middle of the screen
 - the bomb explodes when it touches the ground or the time runs out
 - any player that survives the explosion gets a point
 - a new round starts after each explosion
