# Exploding volleyball

This is a simple 2D game that I wrote to play with Elm. Specifically, I wanted to build my intuition about how to organize Elm applications as they grow. I didn't focus on fun much at all, so it probably only has a few minutes worth of entertainment value.


## Gameplay
 - Two players bounce a bomb back and forth over a net in the middle of the screen
 - The bomb explodes when it touches the ground or the time runs out
 - Any player that survives the explosion gets a point
 - A new round starts after each explosion
 - Either player can be human or AI controlled
